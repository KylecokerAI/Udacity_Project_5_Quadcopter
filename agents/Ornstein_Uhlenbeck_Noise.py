# File Name: Ornstein_Uhlenbeck_Noise.py 

# File Description: We'll use a specific noise process that has some 
#   desired properties, called the Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process. 
#   It essentially generates random samples from a Gaussian (Normal) distribution,
#   but each sample affects the next one such that two consecutive samples are 
#   more likely to be closer together than further apart. In this sense, 
#   the process in Markovian in nature

# Used in the following Project: 
#       Project Name: Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly
